In today's digital age, it is more important than ever for startups to communicate their message clearly and engagingly. An animated explainer video is one of the most effective ways to do this. Animated explainer videos can simplify complex ideas, showcase products or services, and create a lasting impression. This blog will go through seven steps to starting an engaging animated explainer video for your startup.

<em>Step 1: Define Your Message</em>

 The first step to creating an animated explainer video for your startup is to define your message. Your message is the core idea you want to communicate to your target audience. It should clearly outline what problem your product or service solves, how it benefits your target audience, and what makes it unique compared to your competitors.

To define your message, you need to answer some critical questions such as:

<i>What problem does your product or service solve?</i>

<i>How does it benefit your target audience?</i>

<i>What makes it unique compared to competitors?</i>

These questions are critical in helping you create a clear and concise script for your video. It would be best if you made your script as engaging and informative as possible while keeping it simple enough for your target audience to understand.

<em>Step 2: Choose Your Style</em> 

Once you have defined your message, it's time to choose the animation style for your explainer video. There are several different animation styles, including <em>2D animation, 3D animation, motion graphics, infographics, character animation, and whiteboard animation.</em> Each type has strengths and weaknesses, so choosing one that best suits your brand personality and the message you want to convey is essential.

For example, 2D animation is excellent for conveying concepts and presenting a sales pitch.
Character animation is suitable for highlighting your product's benefits from a customer's perspective, and involves story-telling.
Motion graphics are perfect for presenting data, while whiteboard animation is excellent for educational videos.
3D animation is better suited for showcasing complex products, like machines. 

<em>Step 3: Create a Storyboard</em> 

A storyboard is a visual representation of your script. It outlines the different scenes and shots that will be included in your video. Creating a storyboard is critical in planning your video and ensuring it aligns with your message. Your storyboard should consist of sketches or illustrations of each scene, along with notes on the dialogue, camera angles, and special effects.

Storyboarding lets you visualize your video and ensure it tells a cohesive story. It also helps you identify any potential issues with your video flow before you start animating.

<em>Step 4: Choose the Right Tools</em> 

Once you have your script and storyboard ready, it's time to choose the right tools to create your animated explainer video. There are several different software and tools available that can help you create professional-quality videos. Some popular choices include <em>Adobe After Effects, Powtoon, and Animaker</em>. Choose a tool that fits your budget and skill level and can help you create the style of animation you have chosen.

<em>Step 5: Animate Your Video</em> 

With your tools and resources in hand, it's time to start animating your video. This is where you bring your message to life through visuals and animations. You should use clear and engaging visuals that support your message. It's essential to keep your energy simple and not overwhelm your audience with too much information. Remember that your video should be 2-3 minutes at maximum, so focus on the most critical points of your message.

When animating, keep in mind the timing and pacing of your video. Use visual cues to help emphasize important points and to create a cohesive story. Don't be afraid to experiment.
