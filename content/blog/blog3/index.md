<em>"I know branding is essential for my business. We all know that. But is video branding required? Why should I invest in creating videos for my business? Is it imperative?"</em>

These are some questions business owners (still) have in their minds. Let's see what makes video branding a must-must-have for your business.

<br/>
<b>It's powerful!</b>

It is one of the most powerful tools available for branding. Ideal branding is storytelling. Stories are powerful. Remember that Bran Stark won the coveted game of thrones because he had the best story? Visuals are powerful. So the combination of visual storytelling is highly effective. 

A large body of research indicates that vision is our most dominant sense. We tend to retrieve information more quickly if we have visual cues. 

If asked to go back in memories, how many of us think about textual data? The visuals tend to stick with us (<em>95% of information compared to text</em>). And there is a reason for that â€“ a large portion of our brain's sensory cortex processes images. We 'feel' with our senses, not through abstract words. That's why movies have always been a big part of our culture. And that's why today, YouTube, Vimeo, Snapchat, and Instagram claim a sizeable chunk of our daily lives. 

Axonn Research found that 7 in 10 people view brands more positively after watching interesting video content from them. Reports say <em>online video is a 600% more effective marketing tool than print and direct mail combined</em>. In another estimate, internet video traffic will account for 80% of all consumer Internet traffic by this year. And guess what? Videos allow you to build trust with search engines, so your ranking goes up. 

According to statistics, you are 53 times more likely to show up first on Google if you have a video embedded on your website. And Google now owns YouTube.

<b>It's convenient!</b>

Most of us have moved on to smartphones for most purposes, and let's be honest, our clients' attention spans aren't getting any longer. Trudging through mounds of information, data, or instructions is a heroic task, and the clients want to avoid that if given a chance. 

Video explains it all. Marketing today is not about selling but about interestingly providing helpful information. And you can't target just the most proactive clients; you have to engage the laziest ones too. The best way to engage is to ignite emotions, and what's a better tool than a video? Let them know about your business and its benefits to them on the go. 

<em>An animated video makes it all understandable and entertaining, no matter how complex the concept is</em>. Right visuals make vague ideas more tangible and welcoming, lasting longer in memory.


<br/>
<b>It's shareable!</b>

What do we do when we witness something exciting happening around us? More often than not, take out our phones and start filming! Because we love to share what we love. 

Will our customers be as tempted to share an official presentation, tedious statistics, boring data, and clumps of text? We've known the impact of shareable stories since medieval times and before. According to Forrester's researchers, <em>we can put thoughts into animation worth 1.8 million words per minute</em>. For example, many people shared the Dollar Shave Club video, making it viral and leading to 24 million views prompting 12,000 orders in two days after it was released. Many of the sharers weren't even looking for razor blades! 

Social networks today emphasize sharing video content. They are coming up with new ways to encourage videos. Facebook has launched 360-degree video, live video, and Lifestage (a video-centric app for teenagers). Instagram has 60-Second videos & Instagram stories, and Twitter offers Periscope. We all know about YouTube's popularity frontiers crossing all around. More social shares translate to more traffic to your site; once they are there, you know what to do.

<b>It's profitable!</b>

Most importantly, videos prove to be an excellent source for lead generation, conversions, and sales. Studies indicate that <em>74% of users buy a product after watching an explainer video about it</em>. Adding a product video on your landing page has increased conversions by up to 80%. Suppose you mention the word 'video' in an email subject line, and the click-through rate increases by 13%. There has been a revolution of sorts in video marketing, with 83% of businesses believing that video marketing gives them a good ROI.

Coming back to the question, should you do it? Yes! Not because everybody else is doing it as fast as they can, but because why would you not utilize one of the most versatile and profitable marketing methods available today to give your business the apparent boost? 

So actually, the question is - Why are you waiting?
