Animated videos have become increasingly popular in recent years, and for a good reason. They offer a unique and engaging way to convey a message and are becoming increasingly accessible to businesses and organizations of all sizes. 

With the rise of social media platforms and the importance of video marketing, animated videos have become a valuable tool for companies and organizations to promote their products and services.

<em>What are animated videos?</em>

Animated videos use animation techniques to create the illusion of motion or change. They can be made using 2D or 3D animation techniques, and they can be used for various purposes, such as marketing, education, entertainment, and more.

<em>Why are animated videos getting traction?</em>

There are several reasons why animated videos are getting more traction these days. Let's take a look at some of them.

<em> 1. Increased engagement </em>

Animated videos are more engaging than others because they are visually appealing and can uniquely tell a story. They can hold the viewer's attention for extended periods, which is essential in today's age of short attention spans. According to a study by Wyzowl, <em>81% of businesses that use video marketing see an increase in sales</em>, and animated videos are a big part of that.

<em>2. Versatility</em>

Animated videos are versatile and can be used for a variety of purposes. They can be used for marketing, education, entertainment, and more. They can also be used to explain complex concepts in a simple and easy-to-understand way. This versatility makes animated videos a valuable tool for businesses and organizations.

<em>3. Cost-effective</em>

Animated videos can be more cost-effective than other videos because they don't require expensive equipment or locations. They can be created using software and a computer, which makes them accessible to businesses of all sizes. This accessibility means that even small businesses can create high-quality animated videos to promote their products or services.

<em>4. Ability to evoke emotions</em>

Animated videos can evoke emotions in the viewer. They can make people laugh, cry, or feel inspired. This emotional connection can be powerful and can lead to a deeper relationship between the viewer and the brand or message being conveyed in the video.

<em>5. Sharable</em>

Animated videos are highly sharable on social media platforms. They are easy to share, and their visual appeal makes them more likely to be shared than other types of content. This sharability can help increase the video's reach and the brand or message being conveyed.
